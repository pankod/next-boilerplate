## About Next.js

Next.js is a minimalistic React framework that runs in the browser and the server. It offers developers an easy way to get started, and as it uses React.js for templating it is also a straightforward way for developers with React experience to get productive fast.

The advantages of this approach is to be able to create Rich User experiences in a uniform way, without compromising Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) factors that are key to good ranking on Google and other search engines. 

This boilerplate make it easier to get started with a well-structured Next.js and TypeScript application.
