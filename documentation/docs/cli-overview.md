Pankod boilerplate is shipped with a CLI tool to streamline the creation of new components. By using the CLI tool, you may easily add pages, class components or functional components to your project and have all the required actions, reducers and imports automatically created for you.

To start the CLI, you may run the following npm command:

```sh
npm run cli
```
