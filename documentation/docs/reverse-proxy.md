A proxy server sits between or intermediary server that forwards requests for content from multiple clients to different servers across the Internet. A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. 

A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.


ENV variable works if ` PROXY_MODE ` defined as local in .env file.

In the `app/proxy` directory you can define the paths you want to implement reverse proxy.
